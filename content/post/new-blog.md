## My new blog...again
Since I was a kid, I have always dreamed of writing a book. Not a book about anything specific, just a book. At some point, I found blogs and websites and decided that even though it wasn't a book if I had a website or a blog of my own it would accomplish the same thing for me. I never stuck with it. I have tried Geocities, blogger, google sites, Wordpress and just about every other platform I could find. So here I am yet again deciding that I want to start a blog. I am pretty sure this time I will stick with it a little better than before. I have come to realize I never had any specific reason to blog before, and I never had any motivation to post new content to my website. So I decided before I start another failed site I needed to come up with good reasons to create posts so I would keep up with it.

### Reasons to blog
- Writing more will help improve my writing ability
- Write guides on how to do things I might want to revisit later
- Using Hugo and Github will enhance my familiarity with git

## What's next?

- [x] Install Hugo on my dev system
- [x] Point my domain to my hosting service
- [x] create my first posts
- [ ] enable server upload via rsync
- [ ] create my own theme
- [ ] keep with it
