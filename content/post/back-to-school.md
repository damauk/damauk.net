I graduated High School in 2005, thirteen years ago. I had always assumed I would attend college, I didn't really know what I was going to attend college for, I just new I would do attend.

Once I have completed the orientation I will be ready to start on July 1. Will this school be a good fit for me? Will I have a good experience? _Only time will tell._
