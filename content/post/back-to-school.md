I graduated High School in 2005, thirteen years ago. I had always assumed I would attend college, I didn't really know what I was going to attend college for, I just new I would do attend. Long story short I went to school off and on for a couple of years and didn't really get anywhere. Fastforward to 2015, the summer before my daughter was born, and I decided I needed to have a college degree, so I decided to go back to school and finish my Associates Degree. I enrolled in two courses during the summer and was planning on taking Calculus III in the fall. Life happened and I only finished the courses during the summer and wasn't able to enroll in Calculus III in the fall semester because the person we had arranged to watch our daughter moved out of town. Life continued to get in the way and my degree got put on the back burner until this past summer.

I had heard a lot about [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/) but I had only heard about the teacher programs. I gave the school a closer look and found they have an interesting model.

<span style="text-decoration:underline"> A couple of interesting things about WGU:</span>

- Compentency based course completion - If I know the material I can complete the requirements and prove competency sooner than the end of the term.
- I will be enrolled in multiple classes concurrently but I am able to focus on a single course and finish it before moving on to the next subject.
- Less expensive than other options if I take as many courses as I possibly can, fewer courses means higher cost per course. WGU costs right around $3500.00 per term (6-months, there are no semesters).
- The program is designed for students that work full time.

After giving the program and school I found the degree programs are designed for individuals that currently work in the field that they are looking to get a degree in but need a degree to advance. The degree programs also seem well suited to non-traditional students, those looking to go back to school and finish a degree.

I fit in the category of "non-traditional" to say the least. I graduated high school in 2005 and went 

Today I recieved notification that I was cleared to start my orientation. Now just have to wait, the orientation becomes available after the 15th of the month. Once I have completed the orientation I will be ready to start on July 1. Will this school be a good fit for me? Will I have a good experience? _Only time will tell._
