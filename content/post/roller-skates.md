So, I've been shopping for new roller skates lately with my thirtieth birthday coming up. I figure that David might let me spend a little more money on frivolous stuff since it's kind of a milestone birthday. Unfortunatly money's a little tight at the moment, so I don't know that we'll be able to swing it, but I've still been looking at the possibilities. 

I'm pretty interested in Antik boots right now as I've heard that they are good for skaters with wide feet, but they have ankle support, which I've never skated with. I don't want to limit my ability to "get low," especially once I've passed my skills test and am able to skate in bouts. The next set of skates I get will have to last me pretty much indefinitely so I want to make sure that I get something suited to my skating style (which is still developing, buy hey). These are really the only boots I've done much research on so I guess I don't really have that much to say on the topic. I'm really looking forward to WyoCup here in a few weeks as SkateRatz out of Loveland, CO and WyoSkate, out of Gillette, WY will both be there. I'm hoping that I will have an opportunity to get my feet measured and get a better idea of what I like out of a skate. I know my SureGrip Rebels are pretty heavy, as are the Fugitive wheels that I got in my fresh meat skate package, and the tongue of the right boot digs into my shin something terrible, so those are things I will be looking out for on my next skates. But the big thing on my mind is fit. My feet are pretty huge for a woman, and quite wide. My SureGrips are size 11 (men's sizing, of course) and have turned out to be a bit too big. 10 1/2s may have been better but I guess I was worried a bit too much about the width and wanted to give myself a little bit of wiggle room. My feet slide toward the toe anytime I get on my toe stops and there is a bit too much play in the ankles.

I have also been shopping for new wheels lately as I decided my 88s were too sticky for the floor we skate on down at the old armory building at the Fremont County Fairground. I borrowed some 93s from coach and they felt pretty good to start with, but at our last practice I found that they were a little too slick. 91s maybe? I do not know. But I think I would like to try Radar Halos. I might ask for those as my 30th birthday gift and transfer them over to my next skates once we're able to afford them.

Yay roller skates!
