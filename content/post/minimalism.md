I am starting a new chapter in my life, well actually I am continuing one I started many years ago. I am enrolled in a distance education program and am currently working toward completing a bachelors degree. I enrolled in a Computer Science program that will take between two and three years to complete. There are many reasons I have decided to finish my degree, many of which I discuss in another post, but one of the most important for me at the moment is financial security. At the moment I am concerned about my family's financial security due to the amount of debt we have. This debt anxiety got me thinking about how I could sell some of what I have to help get out of debt, which in turn has me thinking about all of the possessions that I have that are just things. Some items I purchased, others were gifts that had sentimental value, but most of these items only occupy space. The vast majority of these things serve no purpose, they have no immediate use, and they bring me no joy. Thinking about my material possessions is what sent me down the path of minimalism, where I discovered the following quote:

> Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns. But we’ve discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning. We’ve learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose.
>
> -Jimmy Carter, Confidence Speech

The most fantastic thing about this quote is that it came from a speech delivered by Jimmy Carter on July 15th, 1979. That is more than seven years before I was born. Its just amazing to me that something said nearly 40 years ago could fit so well today. As I thought more amount minimalism I kept wondering if minimalism is genuinely new or original? On one level I felt it was new because it helps one eschew the current consumer culture and strive for meaning in life through purposeful acts and intentional consumption. Then it hit me; minimalism is exceptionally similar to aspects of transcendentalism. 

>A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone."
>
> -Henry David Thoreau, Walden

I imagine the wealth that Thoreau is referring to has more to do with intellectual and spiritual wealth, but I believe if appropriately applied the sentiment could apply to all forms of wealth. In fact going back even further, we find Epicurus talking about happiness in a similar fashion way back in the third century BCE.

>Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.
>
> -Epicurus

Now I'm not a philosophy expert, but that sure sounds similar in sentiment to the previous quotes. I realize that you can't distill entire movements that span hundreds of years to a single quote, but to me, these quotes get to the heart of the issue that I have at the moment. Phew! That was a long one. So what is the TL;DR? Here is what minimalism means to me:

>Giving up unnecessary material wealth to afford the freedom to pursue that which makes one happy.
